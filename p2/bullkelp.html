                Bull kelp forests grow from the sea floor and create vast forests that become hubs
                of biodiversity. These forests last for just 6 months and then it all washes ashore.

                In the wild, the kelp lifecycle begins when mature
                kelp plants release millions of microscopic spores
                into the surrounding waters.

                Bull kelp is an annual seaweed — meaning it grows from a spore to <br>
                maturity within a single year. It grows quickly, sometimes 10 inches <br>
                (25.4 cm) in one day. It acts as the primary producer for this unique <br>
                ecosystem, similar to oak trees.

                It is the canopy under which countless other seaweeds grow including
                the understory kelps and pink rock-encrusting coralline algae that attract
                the settling of urchin and abalone and young bull kelp. Under the gestural
                swaying largess of the bull kelp is a colorful world with sea stars and
                nudibranchs and sponges. 
                <br>
                There are other large kelps in the mix—Macrocystis pyrifera, or giant kelp,
                dominates the kelp forests south of Monterey clear to Mexico, and
                understory kelps such as feather boa kelp and bladder-chain wrack will be 
                found washing ashore—but from Central California to Alaska, bull kelp is
                the major player, massive and hefty, thriving in the nutrient-rich, cold
                waters of the Northern Pacific.

                By late summer, bull kelp reaches maturity. In the process, 
                it forms canopy-like “underwater islands” that create critical 
                habitat for species like rockfish, scallops, shrimp, and even sea otters.

                Kelp forests harbor a greater variety and higher diversity of plants and animals 
                than almost any other ocean community. Many organisms use the thick blades as a safe 
                shelter for their young from predators or even rough storms.

                Within the kelp forests there is a delicate give and take between the 
                creatures that call this environment home. The decline of the sea urchin's 
                main predators has caused their population to boom, and because the bull 
                kelp acts as one of their main food sources, the urchins end up decimating 
                the kelp forests.

                In their afterlife bull kelp and other kelps form the base of <br>
                the food chain when washed up on the beach just as they <br>
                form the base of the food chain when vibrant and alive in <br>
                the kelp forest below  the ocean's surface. Sand-dwelling <br>
                invertebrates, such as kelp flies, isopods, beach hoppers, <br>
