                Bull kelp forests grow from the sea floor and create vast forests that become hubs
                of biodiversity. These forests last for just 6 months and then it all washes ashore.

                In the wild, the kelp lifecycle begins when mature
                kelp plants release millions of microscopic spores
                into the surrounding waters.

                These spores settle on hard substrates, like rocks, where they

                Bull kelp is an annual seaweed — meaning it grows from a spore to
                maturity within a single year. It grows quickly, sometimes 10 inches 
                (25.4 cm) in one day. It acts as the primary producer for this unique 
                ecosystem, similar to oak trees.

                It is the canopy under which countless other seaweeds grow including
                the understory kelps and pink rock-encrusting coralline algae that attract
                the settling of urchin and abalone and young bull kelp. Under the gestural
                swaying largess of the bull kelp is a colorful world with sea stars and
                nudibranchs and sponges.

                There are other large kelps in the mix—Macrocystis pyrifera, or giant kelp,
                dominates the kelp forests south of Monterey clear to Mexico, and
                understory kelps such as feather boa kelp and bladder-chain wrack will be 
                found washing ashore—but from Central California to Alaska, bull kelp is
                the major player, massive and hefty, thriving in the nutrient-rich, cold
                waters of the Northern Pacific.

                By late summer, bull kelp reaches maturity. In the process, 
                it forms canopy-like “underwater islands” that create critical 
                habitat for species like rockfish, scallops, shrimp, and even sea otters.

                Kelp forests harbor a greater variety and higher diversity of plants and animals 
                than almost any other ocean community. Many organisms use the thick blades as a safe 
                shelter for their young from predators or even rough storms.

                Sea urchin
            </p>

            <p class="body">
                Sea urchins are part of all of the world's kelp forests. A sea urchin's 
                mouth is comprised of five radial, bony teeth in its underside that can 
                scrape and nibble. They typically live healthy existences lodged in one 
                place, often a niche or alcove created in the rock, eating the detritus 
                that floats by. But urchins are voracious. They eat a lot.
            </p>

            <p class="body">
                When a kelp forest is in balance, with ample algal material floating 
                around, urchins have plentiful innards, or gonads (what we know as uni, 
                the golden stuff eaten as sushi), which provide a good source of protein 
                for their predators, the sea otter and the sunflower sea star. These 
                predators keep kelp forests in balance. If systems shift and there is 
                not enough floating algal material, the urchin can get up and move on their 
                suctioned tube feet that emerge between their spines, and go on the march 
                looking for kelp.

                Sunflower Sea Star
            </p>

            <p class="body">
                The sunflower sea star, Pycnopodia helianthoides, is deeply connected to 
                the bull kelp forests of the North Pacific. Pycnopodia is not one of the 
                sea star we find among the rocks at the edge of the beach at low tide; it 
                inhabits the deeper waters. They move swiftly (for a sea star) to swarm 
                over and eat other invertebrates, both alive and dead, living in their 
                ocean bottom habitat.
            </p>

            <p class="body">
                They are an impressive predator, and, in the absence of sea otters in the 
                kelp forests, they can keep urchin populations in check, maintaining these 
                thriving habitats of biodiversity. Sea Star Wasting Disease wiped out almost 
                every single sea star along the West coast of North America. With the resiliency 
                already compromised by the extirpation of the sea otter, many kelp forests 
                along the coast were left with no urchin predator at all.

            <p class="body">
                Sea otters are voracious top predators, their favorite prey are sea urchins, 
                clams, abalone, crab and other mollusks as well as sea cucumbers. They are 
                associated with the kelp beds they live within, keeping the urchin grazer in 
                control so the kelp beds and the richness of life they support can thrive.
            </p>
            <p class="body">
                The otter's capacity to hunt and eat urchins is a crucial dynamic to healthy 
                bull kelp forest habitat, keeping urchin populations at levels that allow the 
                bull kelp to reproduce and for delicate juvenile bull kelp to grow to maturity.

                Within the kelp forests there is a delicate give and take between the 
                creatures that call this environment home. The decline of the sea urchin's 
                main predators has caused their population to boom, and because the bull 
                kelp acts as one of their main food sources, the urchins end up decimating 
                the kelp forests.

                In their afterlife bull kelp and other kelps form the base of 
                the food chain when washed up on the beach just as they 
                form the base of the food chain when vibrant and alive in 
                the kelp forest below  the ocean's surface. Sand-dwelling 
                invertebrates, such as kelp flies, isopods, beach hoppers, 
                and roly polies consume this organic kelp wrack and, in 
                turn, are the chief target for hungry shorebirds.
